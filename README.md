Hello! 👋
I'm a student at THI Ingolstadt, pursuing a degree in Autonomous Vehicle Engineering with a deep curiosity for how machines think, learn, and solve problems. Right now, I'm at the beginner level in Python, but I'm on a mission to turn that foundation into a powerful toolset for engineering and technology.

Why I code: For me, coding isn’t just about writing lines of instructions—it's a way to teach computers, unlock new possibilities, and challenge my own thinking. I believe in using code to expand not only the machine’s capabilities but also my own problem-solving skills.

Why Autonomous Vehicles? I’m fascinated by the world of autonomous systems, where innovation is shaping the future of mobility and transportation. I want to contribute to this exciting field, blending engineering principles with advanced programming to develop systems that are safe, efficient, and reliable.

What I bring:

🧩 Problem-solving mindset: I strive to be more than just a coder. I aim to be a solution-driven programmer, someone who understands the “why” behind each project and can creatively tackle complex challenges.
💻 Learning every day: I’m committed to growing my skills—Python is just the start. I’m eager to dive into machine learning, computer vision, and other technologies essential to autonomous systems.
🚀 Driven by curiosity: I’m motivated by a desire to push boundaries and explore what I’m capable of, one project at a time.
If you're passionate about AI, robotics, or autonomous systems, let’s connect! I'm excited to learn from others and collaborate with like-minded individuals on this journey.
